# Mod Calculator

An iOS app that looks like the regular calculator, but works in a modulus.

Developed to make the cryptography problem sets in the discrete math class at SPCS take just a few minutes. Though I finished it a few days after we had to turn in that problem set, but it could still be useful for next year's class.
